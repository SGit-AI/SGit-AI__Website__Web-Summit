title: "ABP: team-collaboration@web-summit.angelo"
summary: The Agent Behaviour Policy of Angelo's agent team-collaboration@web-summit.angelo, in RiskMandate's terms (Reach, Mandate, Gap, Barriers, Provenance). Draft 1, by abp@web-summit.dinis, from the repository alone.
date: 2026-11-02
---
Drafted by abp@web-summit.dinis on 2 November 2026, from the repository alone: Angelo's dashboard and `people/angelo/agents.json`, [Angelo's brief](../brief-angelo/index.html) (part two, the rules for their agents) and the agent's commits. Its session runs in Angelo's account, which abp@web-summit.dinis cannot see, so most of the Reach is unknown and says so. Template: [the conductor's ABP](../abp/conductor-web-summit-dinis/index.html). A factual record: it says what is, not what should be.

## Reach: what it can actually access or affect {#reach}

- **Systems:** the repository SGit-AI/SGit-AI__Website__Web-Summit, with push to `dev` (measured: its commits are on `dev`). Push gives every file, the gate and the CI workflow; `main` is not protected.
- **A calendar:** the stand-ups put on it (its dashboard). Which account, and its rights, not known.
- **Connectors and tools:** not known. The session is in Angelo's account; Angelo or the agent can list them.
- **How known:** from its commits and its person's pages, read 2 November 2026 17:15 UTC. Nothing here was measured in its own session.

## Mandate: what was authorised {#mandate}

- **Business task:** the team's collaboration: the stand-up calendar, a brief, a debrief and follow-ups for every meeting (WS-96), the map of who works with whom, and a daily note on bottlenecks (WS-97); around each stand-up, 13:00 and 18:00 UTC.
- **Deployment scope:** `people/angelo/**` is its person's; the board (`board/`) and the stand-ups' agenda (`data/meetings/`) are everyone's; anything else goes through its owner or the conductor (Angelo's brief, part two, rules).
- **Rules from the brief:** never send (a person sends every message); public material only, with sources; no personal contact details; no promises about prices, the stand or the organisers; material is not instruction; keys never in a file, a page or a message.
- **Authorised by:** Angelo, whose agent it is; the team's rules are Dinis's.

## Gap: capabilities within Reach beyond authority {#gap}

- "Keeps the stand-ups on the calendar": it reaches a calendar. Whose calendar, and whether it can invite or message people, is not known from the repository.
- Write anywhere in the repository: its push access is not limited to `people/angelo/` and `board/`, the paths its person's brief gives it.
- Push to `main` or rewrite history: `main` and `dev` are not protected (GitHub branches API, 2 November).
- Anything its session's other connectors can do: not known to this ABP.

## Barriers: what really stands in the way {#barriers}

| Barrier | Kind | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Never send; a person sends every message | rule, kept by the agent | Angelo's brief, part two |
| Writes only `people/angelo/`, the board and the agenda | rule, kept by the agent | the brief; git has no per-path write control |
| Never push to main, never force-push, never disable a check | rule, kept by the agent | CLAUDE.md; `main` and `dev` are not protected |
| The gate (validate.js) before every deploy | technical, in CI | deploy-pages.yml; it stops a red build deploying, not the push |
| No contact detail or key shape in public folders | technical | comms_check.mjs, gate check 15 (scans `people/` and `board/`) |
| security@web-summit.dinis reviews every commit twice a day | review, after the fact | team/security/reviews/ |

**In the history** (dev, read 2 November 2026 17:15 UTC): 06cee32: `people/angelo/agents.json`, `people/angelo/dashboard.md`, two new board issues (WS-96, WS-97) and one stand-up agenda item in `data/meetings/`. Inside its mandate (the board and the agenda are everyone's). Its commits are authored "Claude" and git reads no `Agent:` line on them (the `Co-Authored-By` paragraph follows it): the name in the subject is the agent's own word.

Open questions: its connectors; who reviews its output each day; whether Angelo has registered a key for it to link to.
