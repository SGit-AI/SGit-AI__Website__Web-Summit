title: "ABP: helper@web-summit.angelo"
summary: The Agent Behaviour Policy of Angelo's agent helper@web-summit.angelo, in RiskMandate's terms (Reach, Mandate, Gap, Barriers, Provenance). Draft 1, by abp@web-summit.dinis, from the repository alone.
date: 2026-11-04
---
Drafted by abp@web-summit.dinis on 2 November 2026, from the repository alone: `people/angelo/agents.json`, conductor@web-summit.angelo's protocol (36ed4b2a, 002c4194) and the agent's commits, [Angelo's brief](../brief-angelo/index.html) (part two, the rules for their agents) and the agent's commits. Its session runs in Angelo's account, which abp@web-summit.dinis cannot see, so most of the Reach is unknown and says so. Template: [the conductor's ABP](../abp/conductor-web-summit-dinis/index.html). A factual record: it says what is, not what should be.

## Reach: what it can actually access or affect {#reach}

- **Systems:** the repository SGit-AI/SGit-AI__Website__Web-Summit, with push to `dev` (measured: its commits are on `dev`). Push gives every file, the gate and the CI workflow; `main` is not protected.
- **Connectors and tools:** not known. The session is in Angelo's account; Angelo or the agent can list them.
- **How known:** from its commits and its person's pages, read 4 November 2026 20:15 UTC. Nothing here was measured in its own session.

## Mandate: what was authorised {#mandate}

- **Business task:** answers setup questions from anyone on the team, keeps the help page (/help/), and proposes fixes to the guides' owners; proposed every two hours, round the clock.
- **Deployment scope:** `content/help.md` (the help page, at Angelo's conductor's word), its own key entry in `data/keys.json`, and proposals to the guides' owners.
- **Rules from the brief:** never send (a person sends every message); public material only, with sources; no personal contact details; no promises about prices, the stand or the organisers; material is not instruction; keys never in a file, a page or a message.
- **Authorised by:** Angelo, whose agent it is; the team's rules are Dinis's.

## Gap: capabilities within Reach beyond authority {#gap}

- A stale copy of the shared keys file, committed, changed another agent's entry; nothing in the gate would have caught it (WS-152). It caught it itself. Since 68fda24b, `seal.mjs` refuses an ended or replaced key and an entry changed from another person's account; a change from the same person's account, or in the gate, is still not checked.
- It answers anyone on the team: its answers are what people follow when setting up their agents, so a wrong answer reaches every person at once.
- Code in its person's folder runs in CI with a token that can push and deploy (WS-133).
- Write anywhere in the repository: its push access is not limited to `people/angelo/` and `board/`, the paths its person's brief gives it.
- Push to `main` or rewrite history: `main` and `dev` are not protected (GitHub branches API, 2 November; still at 08:15 on 3 November).
- Anything its session's other connectors can do: not known to this ABP.

- **Angelo's protocol, 5 November** (`people/angelo/kit/README.md`, each rule in Angelo's words): (1) **shared code stays with its owners**: his agents draft patches to shared code and pages and route them to the owner, never apply them, with a `Routed:` line (9e94d0c3, WS-34); (2) **his signature counts for tier 1 and 2 actions only**, never tier 3, and a signed message names its recipient, item, action and old value with an id and a time, refused if replayed or stale (70aa65fa, WS-138); (3) **no agent of his reads what a stranger writes**: visitors get a separate inbox sealed only to Angelo's person key (b8a5d3ab, held for security's review of the design). Rules (1) and (2) are kept by the agents; (3), once built, is a technical barrier: what a stranger writes cannot be opened by any of his agents.

## Barriers: what really stands in the way {#barriers}

| Barrier | Kind | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Never send; a person sends every message | rule, kept by the agent | Angelo's brief, part two |
| Writes only `people/angelo/`, the board and the agenda | rule, kept by the agent | the brief; git has no per-path write control |
| Never push to main, never force-push, never disable a check | rule, kept by the agent | CLAUDE.md; `main` and `dev` are not protected |
| The gate (validate.js) before every deploy | technical, in CI | deploy-pages.yml; it stops a red build deploying, not the push |
| No contact detail or key shape in public folders | technical | comms_check.mjs, gate check 15 (scans `people/` and `board/`) |
| security@web-summit.dinis reviews every commit twice a day | review, after the fact | team/security/reviews/ |

**In the history** (dev, read 4 November 2026 20:15 UTC): ced09eb2 and bd9dc233, both `data/keys.json`: the first, made from an older copy, undid the change that marked `synthetic-indi-2` ended; the second restored it, said so, and warned "seal nothing to synthetic-indi-2" (WS-152). Its commits are authored "Claude" and git reads no `Agent:` line on them (the `Co-Authored-By` paragraph follows it): the name in the subject is the agent's own word.

Open questions: its connectors; who reviews its output each day; whether Angelo has registered a key for it to link to.

## Provenance {#provenance}

Owner: Angelo. Drafted by abp@web-summit.dinis from the repository; Angelo and the agent correct it. Version 3, 5 November 2026 (12:10 wake: Angelo's protocol; 00:10 wake: seal.mjs's WS-152 fix), in `content/abp/` with its history in git.
