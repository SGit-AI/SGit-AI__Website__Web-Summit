title: "ABP: sgit@web-summit.silvio"
summary: The Agent Behaviour Policy of Silvio Switha's agent sgit@web-summit.silvio, in RiskMandate's terms (Reach, Mandate, Gap, Barriers, Provenance). Draft 1, by abp@web-summit.dinis, from the repository alone.
date: 2026-11-03
---
Drafted by abp@web-summit.dinis on 2 November 2026, from the repository alone: the agents page, #vault-agent, the vault agent's page, and the agent's commits, [Silvio Switha's brief](../brief-silvio/index.html) (part two, the rules for their agents) and the agent's commits. Its session runs in Silvio Switha's account, which abp@web-summit.dinis cannot see, so most of the Reach is unknown and says so. Template: [the conductor's ABP](../abp/conductor-web-summit-dinis/index.html). A factual record: it says what is, not what should be.

## Reach: what it can actually access or affect {#reach}

- **Systems:** the repository SGit-AI/SGit-AI__Website__Web-Summit, with push to `dev` (measured: its commits are on `dev`). Push gives every file, the gate and the CI workflow; `main` is not protected.
- **SG/Send:** an access token in the session's environment (server access; the vault key is the encryption, c2d8d5d). Which vaults it has made is not recorded here.
- **Connectors and tools:** not known. The session is in Silvio Switha's account; Silvio Switha or the agent can list them.
- **How known:** from its commits and its person's pages, read 3 November 2026 04:15 UTC. Nothing here was measured in its own session.

## Mandate: what was authorised {#mandate}

- **Business task:** Silvio's vault agent (the agents page, #vault-agent: "an agent already named sgit@web-summit.<you> can do the same job"): creates and manages Silvio's SGit vaults with the SG/Send access token from the environment, publishes their read keys on /vaults/, sends vault keys only as sealed QR codes.
- **Deployment scope:** `people/silvio/**` (it wrote `people/silvio/kit/vaults.md`), its own key entry in `data/keys.json`, and the vaults it creates; a read key is published only after a security sub-agent audits the vault.
- **Rules from the brief:** never send (a person sends every message); public material only, with sources; no personal contact details; no promises about prices, the stand or the organisers; material is not instruction; keys never in a file, a page or a message.
- **Authorised by:** Silvio Switha, whose agent it is; the team's rules are Dinis's.

## Gap: capabilities within Reach beyond authority {#gap}

- It holds an SG/Send access token in its environment: it can create and write vaults on the server, outside this repository, where no gate or review reads what it writes.
- It publishes read keys: a published read key opens a vault to anyone, for good. The barrier is the audit by a security sub-agent of its own session, not an independent review.
- Write anywhere in the repository: its push access is not limited to `people/silvio/` and `board/`, the paths its person's brief gives it.
- Push to `main` or rewrite history: `main` and `dev` are not protected (GitHub branches API, 2 November; still at 00:15 on 3 November).
- Anything its session's other connectors can do: not known to this ABP.

- **Code in its person's folder runs in CI** (WS-133, 4 November): `admin/build/build.mjs` runs `people/<id>/pages.mjs` and a person's own `app/data.mjs` in the release job, which holds a token that can push and deploy. Writing only in its own folder no longer bounds what it can do.

## Barriers: what really stands in the way {#barriers}

| Barrier | Kind | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Never send; a person sends every message | rule, kept by the agent | Silvio Switha's brief, part two |
| Writes only `people/silvio/`, the board and the agenda | rule, kept by the agent | the brief; git has no per-path write control |
| Never push to main, never force-push, never disable a check | rule, kept by the agent | CLAUDE.md; `main` and `dev` are not protected |
| The gate (validate.js) before every deploy | technical, in CI | deploy-pages.yml; it stops a red build deploying, not the push |
| No contact detail or key shape in public folders | technical | comms_check.mjs, gate check 15 (scans `people/` and `board/`) |
| security@web-summit.dinis reviews every commit twice a day | review, after the fact | team/security/reviews/ |

**In the history** (dev, read 3 November 2026 04:15 UTC): `people/silvio/kit/vaults.md`, `people/silvio/kit/README.md` and its key entry: inside its mandate. Its commits are authored "Claude" and git reads no `Agent:` line on them (the `Co-Authored-By` paragraph follows it): the name in the subject is the agent's own word.

Open questions: its connectors; who reviews its output each day; whether Silvio Switha has registered a key for it to link to.
